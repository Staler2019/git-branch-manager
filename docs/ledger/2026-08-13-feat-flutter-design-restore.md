# 2026-08-13 · feat/flutter-design-restore — UX3 評分第一輪

Moved out of CLAUDE.md when the rules were split into `docs/rules/`
(ledger: 2026-08-31-docs-split-rules-for-parallel-rounds). The text below is
unchanged; only its location is. The standing rubric it was scored against
stayed behind as [UX-rubric](../rules/ops-ux-rubric.md).

Original round: commit `9b3ff16`, PR **#34**.

### Score trajectory

| Round | A | B | C | D | Total | Change |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (baseline) | 27/30 | 20/25 | 22/25 | 15/20 | 84/100 | — |
| 1 | 29/30 | 24/25 | 24/25 | 18/20 | **95/100** | +11 |

Stop condition (≥90) met after one round; the two-consecutive-round plateau
safety-stop was never triggered.

**What actually changed in Round 1** — most of the delta was correcting
Round 0's unverified assumptions, not new code, and that's disclosed
deliberately rather than let the number imply more work happened than did:

1. *Real fix (D, +3)*: `TabRow`'s Working Copy tab was plain text with no
   signal that changes were pending while the user was looking at History —
   a `material_state_hidden` violation of `ux3.rule.human_factors_load`.
   Added a `GbmBadge` count badge sourced from
   `session.workingCopyStatus.entries.length`. Extracted
   `_TabRow`/`_Tab`/`_MoreMenu` into
   `features/workspace/widgets/tab_row.dart` (mirroring the
   `MenuBarRow`/`ActionToolbar` presentational split) so it's independently
   testable; 4 new widget tests in `tab_row_test.dart`.
2. *Corrected assumption (A, +2)*: Round 0 assumed a missing "checkout
   commit" affordance from History cost points. Grepping `history_graph/`
   found no such feature anywhere in the code or docs/FEATURES.md — it was
   never in product scope, not a discoverability gap.
3. *Corrected assumption (B, +4)*: Round 0 assumed some of the dialog routes
   might be orphaned. A full audit (not sampling) found zero: see the route
   tree section above.
4. *Corrected assumption (C, +2)*: Round 0 estimated bulk "delete gone
   branches" at 3–4 steps. Reading `sidebar_panel.dart` showed it's 2 steps
   (select-all-gone icon → Delete), with no intermediate confirmation dialog.
