# Testing tiers and fixtures

Pin prefix `TEST-`. Format: [README.md](README.md).

## [TEST-tiers] Testing tiers

- **Unit** (`test/actions/gbm_action_availability_test.dart`, and pure-model
  tests elsewhere) — no widgets, no Riverpod. Exercises `isActionEnabled()`
  directly against every id + a representative `RepoSessionState`.
- **Widget** (`test/features/**/*_test.dart`) — a single presentational
  widget (`MenuBarRow`, `TabRow`, `BranchTreeItem`, ...) pumped with plain
  callbacks/`ProviderContainer` overrides and a fake session, per-widget in
  isolation. This is where most of the suite lives, and it cannot catch a
  dispatch-path bug like the one above, because it never goes through
  `WorkspaceScreen._buildActionHandlers()` — it feeds a handler map (or
  named callback) directly to the widget under test.
- **Integration** (`test/integration/`, run by the same `flutter test`, no
  separate `integration_test/` device harness) — the real
  `WorkspaceScreen` behind a `GoRouter`, driven by
  `test/support/pump_workspace.dart`'s `pumpWorkspace()`. Exists
  specifically to cross the seam widget tests can't: does a keyboard
  shortcut/menu click/system-menu path really reach the controller, does a
  state transition (conflict ↔ clean, an interrupt overlay opening) leave
  every gated surface consistent with no residue, does navigating into
  `ConflictResolveWindow` and back preserve the right content. Use
  `pumpWorkspace`'s `extraRoutes` for a route that's a ShellRoute child in
  the real router (Compare tab) and `topLevelRoutes` for one that's a
  sibling of it (any `dialogRoute(...)`, `conflicts`) — mixing them up tests
  the wrong route structure and can pass for the wrong reason.

## [TEST-fake-session-seam] The fake session seam

**Fake session seam** (`test/support/fake_repo_session.dart`):
`FakeRepoSessionController extends RepoSessionController`, constructed with
a `FakeGbmBindings` whose `sessionOpen()` returns `nullptr` — the real
`_open()` sees that as "open failed" and returns before touching bindings or
recents again, so every controller method the fake doesn't override hits its
own `if (_session == nullptr) return;` guard and safely no-ops. Overridden
methods do the opposite: they record the call into `commandLog` (or a
bespoke field, for the handful of tests written before `commandLog` existed)
instead of no-opping. `FakeGbmBindings`/`FakeRecentsRepository` throw via
`noSuchMethod` on anything not explicitly implemented — a provider a test
forgot to override fails loudly instead of quietly reaching a real
`.dylib`/`.so`. Call `controller.emit(nextState)` to simulate an FFI event
publishing a new `RepoSessionState`, exactly as `_onEvent()` would.

## [TEST-new-gate-needs-integration] A new state-dependent gate needs an integration test

**Rule**: a new state-dependent gate goes into `isActionEnabled()` (or, if
it's not action-shaped, gets an equally-named single function) *and* gets an
integration test asserting the gated surface actually changes when the
state transitions — a widget test alone proves the widget renders `null`
correctly, not that the real dispatch path ever produces that `null`.
